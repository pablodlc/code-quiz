# code-quiz

A DOM-manipulated, five question, timed quiz. The user has 75 seconds to answer five questions about coding. A right answer adds 10 seconds to the clock, a wrong answer subtracts 10 seconds. At the end, the user's score is the seconds remaining. The application uses local storage to save the top five high scores to a high score display.
